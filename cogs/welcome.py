Owlet is dedicated to fostering player growth and improvement. That said, the more you put into our tournament, the more you will get out of it. To help you achieve your personal goals and become a successful player in our tournament, we encourage you to adhere to the following guidelines and expectations:
     > Commit to attending matches; Game matches take 1.5 - 2 hours (two per week).
     > Attend team related activities such as practices, scrimmages, map reviews, and vod reviews, which can take 2 - 6+ hours a week (these durations are suggestions only and actual durations will be at your coachâ€™s discretion).
          - During season 1, the typical player committed 4 - 12 hours to Owlet related activities.
     > Be receptive to feedback from your coaches to continuously improve as a player and teammate.
     >Be compliant to all the rules of the Owlet tournament.

As a reminder, if you are applying to the tournament as a free agent, you must take it upon yourself to seek a team through tryouts, networking and engagement with your fellow Owlets.
